When I was nine years old I found QBasic on my parent’s computer. It quickly became my favorite game. I have been intrigued by computers and programming languages ever since.

There are about 50 languages in which I have written at least one program. My favorite languages are JavaScript, PHP and C#. I continue to learn more every day and keep up with today’s advancing technologies.

In high school I started a computer repair business in high school, mostly working for family members and friends, and started freelance programming through websites such as GetACoder.com. I have worked on many projects with many different kinds of people and pride myself on being able to work with every one of them successfully.

I am a very easy-going and open person who thinks logically about every decision. I consider myself a very lucky person to have found what I want to do for the rest of my life at a very early age. To answer every high school counselor’s question, if I had $1,000,000 I would write applications that make the world more efficient.
