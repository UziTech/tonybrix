When I was nine years old I found QBasic on my parent’s computer. It quickly became my favorite game. Ever since then I have been intrigued by computers and programming languages.

There are about 40 languages in which I have written at least one program. My favorite languages are Javascript, PHP and C#. I continue to learn more every day and keep up with today’s advancing technologies.

I started my own computer repair business in high school, mostly working for family members and friends. Also in high school I started freelance programming through websites such as GetACoder.com and others. I have worked on many projects with many different kinds of people and have been able to work with every one of them successfully.

I am a very easy going and open person who thinks logically about every decision. I consider myself a very lucky person to have found what I want to do for the rest of my life at a very early age. To answer every high school counselor’s question, if I had $1,000,000 I would write programs for anybody and everybody.
